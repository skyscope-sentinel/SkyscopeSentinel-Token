# SKYSCOPESENTINEL (SKYSCOPE) SPL Token Creation Script Outline
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# This script provides a template of Solana CLI commands to create the SKYSCOPE SPL token.
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have the Solana CLI installed and configured.
#    See: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
# 2. Configuration: You must have a Solana wallet configured (e.g., a file system wallet).
#    The default fee payer for these commands will be your configured Solana CLI wallet.
#    Ensure this wallet has enough SOL to cover transaction fees.
# 3. Review & Uncomment: Carefully review each command. You will need to uncomment them
#    and potentially adjust parameters before execution.
# 4. Execute Sequentially: It's recommended to run these commands one by one or in small groups
#    to monitor output and handle any errors.
# 5. THIS IS AN OUTLINE: Error handling beyond basic CLI output is not included.
#    For production scenarios, more robust scripting or direct program interaction is advised.

# --- Step 1: Generate Keypair for the Token Mint (if it doesn't exist) ---
# The mint account itself is a new public key.

# --- Step 2: Create the SKYSCOPE Token ---
# This command creates the actual token mint on the blockchain.
# The `solana address` is your currently configured CLI wallet, which will be the default mint authority.
# You can specify a different mint authority with `--mint-authority <KEYPAIR_PATH_OR_PUBKEY>`.

# --- Step 3: Create an Account to Hold SKYSCOPE Tokens (for the Treasury/Genesis Pool) ---
# This account will receive the initial minted supply.
# It's typically an Associated Token Account (ATA) for the mint authority or a dedicated treasury wallet.
# For simplicity, creating an ATA for your CLI default wallet (which is also the mint authority here).
# echo "Step 3: Creating Treasury/Genesis Token Account for SKYSCOPE..."
# spl-token create-account $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS # This creates an ATA for your default wallet

# --- Step 5: Create Owner's SKYSCOPE Token Account (if they don't have one) ---
# An Associated Token Account for the owner's wallet to receive their allocation.
# The fee payer for creating this ATA is your CLI default wallet.
# echo "Step 5: Creating Token Account for Owner ($OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS)..."
# spl-token create-account $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS --owner $OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS --fee-payer $(solana-keygen pubkey $TOKEN_MINT_AUTHORITY_KEYPAIR_PATH) # Example if fee payer is different
# # Simpler: create ATA for owner, current CLI wallet pays fees
# # NOTE: The owner might need to create this themselves if you don't want to pay fees for them,
# # or if they want to use a specific account. ATA is generally recommended.
# # The command below will create an ATA for the owner if it doesn't exist.
# # The fee payer is your default CLI wallet.
# solana spl-token create-associated-token-account --owner $OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS --mint $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS --payer $(solana address)
# OWNER_SKYSCOPE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=$(solana spl-token address --owner $OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS --mint $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS)

# --- Step 6: Transfer SKYSCOPE Tokens to the Owner's Wallet ---
# Transferring $OWNER_TOKEN_ALLOCATION_RAW $TOKEN_SYMBOL from the Treasury account to the Owner's account.
# The owner of the source account (Treasury account - your CLI default wallet) must sign.
# echo "Step 6: Transferring $OWNER_TOKEN_ALLOCATION_RAW $TOKEN_SYMBOL to Owner's Account ($OWNER_SKYSCOPE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS)..."

# # Note: --fund-recipient handles creating the ATA for the owner if it doesn't exist and you are paying.
# # If the owner's ATA was created in Step 5, you might not need --fund-recipient, but it's safer.
# echo "Successfully transferred $OWNER_TOKEN_ALLOCATION_RAW $TOKEN_SYMBOL to the owner."

# --- Step 7: (Optional) Disable Future Minting ---
# If you want a fixed supply and no more tokens can ever be minted.
# This action is IRREVERSIBLE for this token mint.
# The current mint authority (your CLI default wallet) must sign.
# echo "Step 7: (Optional) Disable Future Minting for $TOKEN_NAME..."

# read -p "Are you absolutely sure you want to disable minting? (yes/N): " confirm_disable_mint

#   spl-token authorize $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS mint --disable # Authority is default CLI wallet
#   echo "Minting has been PERMANENTLY DISABLED for $TOKEN_NAME ($TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS)."
# else
#   echo "Minting was NOT disabled."

# echo "---"

# --- Step 8: (Optional) Add Metadata using Metaplex Token Metadata ---
# This step requires having the Metaplex CLI or a similar tool.
# For simplicity, this is a placeholder for the commands.
# You would typically:
# 1. Upload your token logo (e.g., skyscope_logo.png) and metadata JSON to a permanent storage (Arweave, IPFS).
# 2. Create the metadata JSON file (e.g., skyscope_metadata.json) with name, symbol, description, image URI, etc.
#
# Example metadata JSON (skyscope_metadata.json):
# {
#   "name": "SKYSCOPESENTINEL",
#   "symbol": "SKYSCOPE",

#       { "address": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE", "share": 100 }
#     ]
#   }
# }
#
# echo "Step 8: (Optional) Add Token Metadata (using Metaplex tools - placeholder)..."
# echo "This requires Metaplex CLI tools like 'mpl-token-metadata create-metadata-accounts'."
# echo "Ensure you have uploaded your logo and metadata JSON to Arweave/IPFS."
# echo "Example command structure (replace with actual mpl-token-metadata command):"
# echo "mpl-token-metadata create-metadata-accounts --mint $TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS --name \"$TOKEN_NAME\" --symbol \"$TOKEN_SYMBOL\" --uri YOUR_METADATA_JSON_URI_ON_ARWEAVE_OR_IPFS -k YOUR_FEE_PAYER_KEYPAIR.json"
