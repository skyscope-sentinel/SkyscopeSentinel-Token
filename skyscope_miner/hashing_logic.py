class SkyscopeHashQ:
    """
    Conceptual Hashing Logic for SKYSCOPE Miner.
    This class simulates the mining process, including the conceptual
    "skyscope-hash-Q" RAM-boosted approach.

    NOTE: This does NOT implement the actual kHeavyHash algorithm used by Kaspa.
    A real implementation would require:
    1. A Python library that implements kHeavyHash (rare, often inefficient for PoW).
    2. Integration with a C/C++/Rust kHeavyHash library via CFFI, Cython, or similar.
    3. Wrapping an existing command-line Kaspa CPU miner and managing its process.

    The "skyscope-hash-Q" RAM boost is a conceptual R&D goal. How RAM could
    effectively boost a CPU-bound algorithm like kHeavyHash would require
    significant research, possibly involving:
    - Pre-computation of parts of the hash if the algorithm has divisible sections.
    - Custom lookup tables or data structures stored in RAM that accelerate specific
      bottleneck operations within kHeavyHash (highly speculative).
    - Optimizing memory access patterns for the CPU's cache hierarchy, potentially
      using RAM to stage data.
    This simulation provides a high-level idea, not a cryptographic implementation.
