class SkyscopeHashQ:
    """
    Hashing Logic for SKYSCOPE Miner, integrating the Python kHeavyHash implementation.
    This class manages the mining process for a given block template.

    "skyscope-hash-Q" RAM Boost Concept:
    ------------------------------------
    The idea behind "skyscope-hash-Q" is to leverage user-configurable system RAM
    to *conceptually* enhance the CPU-bound kHeavyHash algorithm. This is an R&D area.
    Potential theoretical approaches (not implemented in the current Python kHeavyHash):

    1.  **Pre-computation & Caching of Intermediate kHeavyHash States:**
        *   If kHeavyHash involves repetitive calculations on certain parts of its internal state
          or uses fixed lookup tables that are large, these could be pre-computed or
          cached in the allocated RAM.
        *   For example, if parts of the matrix multiplication in kHeavyHash could be broken down
          and intermediate products for common input patterns stored.
        *   Challenge: kHeavyHash is designed to be memory-hard in a way that makes caching
          difficult or less effective; its internal state changes rapidly with each hash attempt.
          Identifying truly static or slowly changing intermediates that are large enough to
          benefit from RAM caching (beyond CPU caches) is key.

    2.  **Optimized Data Structures for kHeavyHash State:**
        *   The algorithm's internal state (e.g., the large matrix) could be organized in RAM
          using data structures that are tailored for CPU cache lines and memory access patterns,
          potentially reducing latency if Python's default object overhead is significant for
          the matrix elements.
        *   Challenge: Python's abstraction layer makes fine-grained memory layout control difficult.
          This would be more applicable to a C/C++/Rust implementation of kHeavyHash.

    3.  **Task Scheduling & Data Staging for Multi-Core CPU:**
        *   If mining is parallelized across multiple CPU cores (which SKYSCOPE Miner aims to do),
          a large RAM buffer could be used to stage upcoming work units (block template variations)
          or manage shared data structures between threads/processes more effectively than relying
          solely on inter-process communication or smaller CPU caches for certain types of shared data.
        *   Challenge: kHeavyHash work units are largely independent per nonce, so shared data
          benefit might be limited unless there's a meta-level optimization.

    4.  **"Quantum-style" (Figurative) Parallel Search Space Exploration:**
        *   This is highly speculative. It might involve using RAM to manage multiple, slightly
          varied search paths or parameter sets for the hashing process simultaneously, then
          heuristically prioritizing paths that seem more "promising." This is far from
          standard PoW mining and enters into heuristic search / AI territory.
        *   Challenge: Defining "promising" paths in PoW without just doing the work is hard.

    **Current Implementation Status:**
    The `ram_percent` and `conceptual_ram_info` are passed to this class. However, the
    `kheavyhash_conceptual_python` function (being a direct, albeit slow, structural
    representation) does not currently incorporate these advanced RAM usage strategies.
    The RAM allocation serves as a user-configurable parameter for this *conceptual framework*.
    A true performance impact would require a low-level kHeavyHash implementation designed
    from the ground up to exploit these RAM-based strategies.
